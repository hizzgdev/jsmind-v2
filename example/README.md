# jsMind V2 Examples

## Demo

`demo.html` - A simple demo showing how to use jsMind V2 API.

### How to run:

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Open `demo.html` in a web browser:
   ```bash
   # Using a simple HTTP server (recommended)
   npm run server
   # Then navigate to http://localhost:8080/example/demo.html
   ```

   Or simply open `demo.html` directly in your browser (some features may not work due to CORS restrictions).

### Note

This demo currently shows the mind map structure as text, since the view system is not yet implemented. Once the view system is completed, the mind map will be rendered visually.
