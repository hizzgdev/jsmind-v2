## Documentation Rules

When generating documentation, save files in the `docs/` directory, organize them into subdirectories by category (`architecture/`, `features/`, `development/`), and use kebab-case for filenames (e.g., `missing-features.md`).

## Code Comments

All comments in the project must be written in English.
